## üîß Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Neo4j Aura account (free tier available)
- Google Gemini API key (free tier available)
- Git (for deployment)

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Setup Neo4j Aura

### Step 1: Create Neo4j Aura Account

1. Go to [Neo4j Aura](https://console.neo4j.io/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Click **"Create Database"** ‚Üí Select **"Free"** tier
4. Choose a name for your database (e.g., "manufacturing-graph")
5. **Important**: Save the password shown - you won't see it again!

### Step 2: Get Connection Details

After creating the database:

1. Click on your database in the console
2. Note down these details:
   - **URI**: `neo4j+s://xxxxxxxx.databases.neo4j.io`
   - **Username**: `neo4j`
   - **Password**: (the one you saved in Step 1)

### Step 3: Open Neo4j Browser

1. In Neo4j Aura console, click **"Open"** next to your database
2. Or click **"Query"** button
3. Login with username `neo4j` and your password

---

## üîç Setup Indexes (Critical)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: These indexes are **required** for Graphiti to work. Run these in Neo4j Browser before using the service.

### Step 1: Create Node Fulltext Index

Open Neo4j Browser and run:

```cypher
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX node_name_and_summary IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (n:Entity)
ON EACH [n.name, n.summary]
```

**What this does**: Creates a fulltext search index on Entity nodes for the `name` and `summary` properties.

### Step 2: Create Edge Fulltext Index

```cypher
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX edge_name_and_fact IF NOT EXISTS
FOR ()-[r:RELATES_TO]-()
ON EACH [r.name, r.fact]
```

**What this does**: Creates a fulltext search index on relationships for the `name` and `fact` properties.

### Step 3: Create Additional Indexes (Recommended)

```cypher
CREATE INDEX entity_uuid IF NOT EXISTS FOR (n:Entity) ON (n.uuid);
CREATE INDEX entity_name IF NOT EXISTS FOR (n:Entity) ON (n.name);
CREATE INDEX episode_uuid IF NOT EXISTS FOR (n:Episode) ON (n.uuid);
```

**What this does**: Creates regular indexes for better query performance.

### Step 4: Verify Indexes

Run this query to check all indexes were created:

```cypher
SHOW INDEXES
```

You should see these indexes:
- ‚úÖ `node_name_and_summary` (FULLTEXT)
- ‚úÖ `edge_name_and_fact` (FULLTEXT)
- ‚úÖ `entity_uuid` (RANGE)
- ‚úÖ `entity_name` (RANGE)
- ‚úÖ `episode_uuid` (RANGE)

---

## üîë Get Google Gemini API Key

### Step 1: Get API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Create API Key"**
4. Copy the API key (starts with `AIza...`)

### Step 2: Save API Key

Keep this key safe - you'll need it for configuration.

## üíæ Installation

### Step 1: Clone or Download Project

```bash
# If using Git
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd manufacturing-graphiti-service

# Or download and extract the ZIP file

## üéì Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Daily Equipment Logs

Add daily logs as episodes:

```bash
# Monday
curl -X POST https://your-service.onrender.com/add-episode \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Equipment Log - 2024-01-15",
    "episode_body": "Machine XYZ operated 8 hours, produced 400 parts...",
    "source_description": "Daily operations log"
  }'

# Tuesday
curl -X POST https://your-service.onrender.com/add-episode \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Equipment Log - 2024-01-16",
    "episode_body": "Machine XYZ operated 6 hours, maintenance performed...",
    "source_description": "Daily operations log"
  }'
```

Then search across all logs:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-service.onrender.com/search-graph \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "How many hours did Machine XYZ operate last week?"
  }'
```

---

### Pattern 2: Incident Reports

Track equipment issues:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-service.onrender.com/add-episode \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Incident Report - INC-2024-001",
    "episode_body": "Machine XYZ-100 experienced overheating at 14:30. Temperature reached 85¬∞C. Emergency shutdown performed by operator Jane Doe. Root cause: cooling system failure. Vendor ABC Parts contacted for replacement parts.",
    "source_description": "Safety incident report"
  }'
```

Later, find related incidents:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-service.onrender.com/search-graph \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What cooling system failures have we had?"
  }'
```

---

### Pattern 3: Maintenance Tracking

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-service.onrender.com/add-episode \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Maintenance - Machine XYZ-100 - 2024-Q1",
    "episode_body": "Quarterly maintenance performed:\n- Oil change completed\n- Bearings inspected, no wear detected\n- Calibration checked and adjusted\n- Software updated to v2.3.1\n- Next service due: April 2024\nTechnician: Mike Johnson\nParts used: Oil Filter OF-123, Lubricant LUB-456",
    "source_description": "Quarterly maintenance schedule"
  }'
```

---

## üîç Advanced Search Examples

### Temporal Queries
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-service.onrender.com/search-graph \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What happened to Machine XYZ-100 in January 2024?"
  }'
```

### Relationship Queries
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-service.onrender.com/search-graph \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Which machines are operated by John Smith?"
  }'
```

### Quality & Performance Queries
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-service.onrender.com/search-graph \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Show me machines with quality issues or low uptime"
  }'
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Graphiti not initialized"

**Symptoms**: Service returns 503 errors

**Solutions**:
1. Check your `.env` file has correct credentials
2. Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set and valid
3. Check Neo4j connection details
4. Restart the service

### Issue: "There is no such fulltext schema index"

**Symptoms**: Errors mentioning `node_name_and_summary` or `edge_name_and_fact`

**Solution**: You forgot to create the indexes! Go back to [Setup Indexes](#setup-indexes-critical) section.

### Issue: Duplicate entities created

**Symptoms**: Search returns multiple similar entities

**Explanation**: This is normal. Graphiti uses AI to merge entities, but it's not 100% perfect. Very similar but slightly different entities might be kept separate.

**Solution**: Use more consistent naming in your episode bodies.

### Issue: Search returns no results

**Solutions**:
1. Wait 3-5 seconds after adding episode for indexing
2. Try different search queries
3. Check if data was actually added: `curl https://your-service.onrender.com/stats`
4. Verify indexes are created: Run `SHOW INDEXES` in Neo4j Browser

### Issue: Slow response times

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce `limit` parameter in searches
2. Check Neo4j Aura instance status
3. Monitor Gemini API quota
4. Consider upgrading Neo4j tier for production

---

## üìä Monitoring

### Check Service Health
```bash
# Quick check
curl https://your-service.onrender.com/

# Detailed health
curl https://your-service.onrender.com/health
```

### Monitor Graph Growth
```bash
# Get statistics
curl https://your-service.onrender.com/stats

# Count episodes
curl https://your-service.onrender.com/episodes?limit=1
```

### View Logs

**Local**:
- Check terminal output

**Render**:
- Go to Render dashboard ‚Üí Your service ‚Üí Logs tab

---

## üîê Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` file** to Git
   ```bash
   # Add to .gitignore
   echo ".env" >> .gitignore
   ```

2. **Use environment variables** in production (Render handles this)

3. **Rotate API keys** periodically

4. **Use Neo4j Aura** for secure managed database

5. **Enable HTTPS** (Render provides this automatically)
